# mmlasso
This package provides the functions to compute the MM-Lasso and adaptive MM-Lasso estimators proposed in Smucler and Yohai (2017). This package was forked from https://github.com/esmucler/mmlasso. We fixed some errors as some functions can not work correctly after these years.

A more efficient implementation, with a lot more options and functionalities, is available as part of the pense package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pense/index.html.
